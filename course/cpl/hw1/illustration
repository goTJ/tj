Compiler HWK#1 Due date: 2:20pm, March 23, 2006

1. Do ASU textbook 3.10(c) and 3.10(d) (page 149).

2. Write a LEX program to do the following:
   a. Input: an ASCII file
   b. Output:
      Copy the file with the following two modifications:
      (1) replace an Arabic number with a Roman number (in upper case);
      (2) replace a Roman number with an Arabic number.

Example:
Input:    <I don't have 51 dollars. I received MM dollars.>
Output:   <1 don't have LI dollars. 1 received 2000 dollars.>

Note: (a) "<" and ">" are not part of the input and output.
      (b) Arabic numbers may have leading zeros, ie, 012 is legal.
          All Arabic numbers are postivie integers < 3000.
      (c) Roman numbers are in upper cases and are < 3000.
      (d) English words are separated by either ",", ".", "!", "?",
          blanks, tabs, start of lines, EOF, or newlines.
          Note: ",", ".", "!", "?" can only be the separation on the right,
          not on the left.
          Example:   2000. ==> MM.
                     .2000 ==> .2000
          Characters can be uppercase/lower cases or mixing.
          A word cannot be broken into two lines using "-".
      (e) I, V, X, L, C, D, M represent 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000,
          respectively, in the Roman system.
      (f) <<EOF>> can be used to match end of file,
          yyterminate() can be used to stop the scanner.
      (g) To submit your homework, check out TA's web page.

This homework MUST execute on FreeBSD workstations in our department.
Submitting files include a lex file, a Makefile, and optional C codes. The
Makefile MUST supports "make clean", "make all", and "make test" for cleaning,
building, and testing the homework. An example of the Makefile can be obtained
from the course web. The object code of your program must be "hwk1".
